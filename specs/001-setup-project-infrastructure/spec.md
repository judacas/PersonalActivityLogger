# Feature Specification: Project Infrastructure Setup

**Feature Branch**: `001-setup-project-infrastructure`  
**Created**: 2025-01-27  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "lets set up the scaffolds for the project. including docker, fastapi scaffold, sample frontend scaffold. project structure, CI/CD, trunk and hooks, tasks.json, and anything else you think we should setup before starting the actual development"

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Docker Development Environment (Priority: P1)

As a developer, I need a consistent Docker development environment so that I can work in a reproducible setup without manual configuration.

**Why this priority**: Docker ensures all developers have identical environments (Python version, Node version, databases). This prevents "works on my machine" issues and aligns with the 12-Factor App principles. Without this, the team cannot reliably develop together.

**Independent Test**: Developers can clone the repository and run `docker-compose up` to start all services (frontend, backend, database) without any manual installation steps. The environment starts successfully and all services are accessible at expected ports.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a developer with Docker installed, **When** they clone the repository and run `docker-compose up`, **Then** all services (frontend dev server, backend API, SQLite database) start successfully and are accessible
2. **Given** a stopped Docker environment, **When** a developer runs `docker-compose restart`, **Then** all services restart cleanly without errors
3. **Given** Docker containers are running, **When** a developer makes code changes to backend or frontend, **Then** changes are reflected in the running application without manual rebuild or restart

---

### User Story 2 - Project Structure and FastAPI Scaffold (Priority: P1)

As a developer, I need a well-organized project structure with a working FastAPI backend so that I can implement features without restructuring code.

**Why this priority**: The project structure defines where code belongs and enforces separation of concerns. The FastAPI scaffold establishes the base API architecture (models, routers, dependencies). Without this, feature development cannot begin.

**Independent Test**: Developers can add a new API endpoint in the correct location (backend structure), the endpoint is accessible via the API client, and it returns expected responses. The project structure follows MVC patterns (models in models/, routers in routers/, services in services/).

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a developer implementing a feature, **When** they add a new API endpoint following the existing pattern, **Then** the endpoint is automatically included in the API documentation and is accessible via HTTP requests
2. **Given** the project structure, **When** a developer navigates to a component (e.g., model, router, service), **Then** they find it in the expected directory location
3. **Given** the FastAPI scaffold is running, **When** a developer visits the `/docs` endpoint, **Then** they see interactive API documentation with all registered endpoints

---

### User Story 3 - Frontend React Scaffold (Priority: P1)

As a developer, I need a working React + Vite frontend scaffold so that I can build user interfaces without setting up build tools.

**Why this priority**: The frontend scaffold establishes the UI foundation, routing, component structure, and API integration patterns. Without this, developers cannot implement user-facing features. It enables parallel development of backend and frontend features.

**Independent Test**: Developers can run the frontend dev server, see a basic page load in the browser, and make a UI change that updates automatically in the browser. The frontend can make API calls to the backend and display responses.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the frontend scaffold is running, **When** a developer opens the application in a browser, **Then** they see a functional React application with basic routing
2. **Given** a developer adds a new page/component, **When** they save the file, **Then** the browser automatically displays the updated UI without manual refresh
3. **Given** the frontend makes an API call to the backend, **When** the response is received, **Then** the UI updates to display the data correctly

---

### User Story 4 - Structured Logging Infrastructure (Priority: P2)

As a developer, I need structured logging infrastructure so that I can debug issues and monitor application behavior during development.

**Why this priority**: Structured logging enables developers to understand application behavior, debug issues, and track errors. A well-designed logging setup is easily extensible for future production monitoring needs. This is P2 because it supplements development but doesn't block initial feature work.

**Independent Test**: Developers can configure log levels (DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL) and see formatted log output in the console. Logging patterns are consistent and easily extensible for future integration with external observability tools.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the backend API is running, **When** developers make requests, **Then** structured logs with appropriate levels are written to stdout/stderr
2. **Given** a developer sets the log level to DEBUG, **When** they make a request, **Then** detailed debug information appears in the logs
3. **Given** an error occurs in the application, **When** it is logged, **Then** the log includes structured information (timestamp, level, message, context) in a consistent format

---

### User Story 5 - CI/CD Pipeline (Priority: P2)

As a developer/team lead, I need automated CI/CD so that code quality is enforced, tests run on every push, and deployments happen automatically.

**Why this priority**: CI/CD ensures quality gates before merge and enables consistent deployments. However, it can be set up after the basic project structure, making it P2 rather than P1.

**Independent Test**: When a developer pushes code to GitHub, the CI pipeline runs tests, linters, and builds Docker images. All checks pass before code can be merged. Failed checks block merge.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a developer pushes code to a pull request, **When** the CI pipeline runs, **Then** all linters, formatters, and tests pass, and merge is allowed
2. **Given** a developer introduces a linting error, **When** they push code, **Then** the CI pipeline fails with a clear error message, and merge is blocked
3. **Given** all CI checks pass on merge to main, **When** CI completes successfully, **Then** code is ready for local development (no cloud deployment for MVP)

---

### User Story 6 - Trunk Integration with Pre-commit Hooks (Priority: P2)

As a developer, I need automated code quality checks via Trunk so that code conforms to standards before commit and I catch issues early.

**Why this priority**: Trunk enforces consistent code quality (linting, formatting) across the team. Pre-commit hooks catch issues before they reach CI, saving time. This is P2 because it supplements but doesn't block initial feature development.

**Independent Test**: When a developer attempts to commit code, Trunk hooks run automatically. If formatting issues exist, they are fixed automatically or commit is blocked with clear error messages. Developers commit successfully after addressing issues.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a developer makes code changes, **When** they attempt to commit, **Then** Trunk runs linters and formatters, and commit proceeds successfully if all checks pass
2. **Given** a developer introduces a formatting violation, **When** they attempt to commit, **Then** Trunk blocks the commit with a clear error message explaining the issue
3. **Given** Trunk auto-fix is enabled for a rule, **When** a developer commits with a fixable issue, **Then** Trunk automatically fixes it and allows the commit to proceed

---

### User Story 7 - tasks.json Configuration (Priority: P2)

As a developer, I need common development tasks configured in `tasks.json` so that I can run frequent operations (tests, migrations, linting) with simple commands.

**Why this priority**: `tasks.json` speeds up daily development workflows (run tests, start dev servers, run migrations). It makes the project more accessible to new developers. This is P2 because manual commands work but are less convenient.

**Independent Test**: Developers can run `./tasks.json run <task-name>` to execute common operations (build Docker images, run tests, start dev environment). Tasks complete successfully and produce expected outputs.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a developer wants to run tests, **When** they execute the test task from `tasks.json`, **Then** all tests run and results are displayed
2. **Given** a developer wants to start the development environment, **When** they run the start task, **Then** all Docker containers start successfully
3. **Given** a developer needs to run database migrations, **When** they execute the migration task, **Then** migrations are applied to the database and the schema is updated

---

### Edge Cases

- What happens when Docker is not installed on the developer's machine? (Should provide clear installation instructions and error messages)
- How does the system handle port conflicts if another service is using port 3000 or 8000? (Should detect and report conflicts, suggest alternate ports)
- What happens when a developer's OS differs (Windows, macOS, Linux)? (Docker ensures consistency across platforms)
- How does the project handle database migrations in Docker vs. local development? (Alembic migrations should work identically in both)
- What happens when a developer runs pre-commit hooks without Trunk installed? (Should provide installation instructions and fallback to manual linting)

## Assumptions

- **Local-Only Architecture**: All infrastructure runs locally on developer machines via Docker. No cloud hosting, remote services, or production deployments are included in this feature (post-MVP only)
- All developers have Docker Desktop installed or can install it (Docker is the primary development environment)
- GitHub is used for version control and CI/CD (GitHub Actions for simplicity)
- Developers are familiar with command-line tools (trunk CLI, docker CLI, npm/yarn)
- SQLite is sufficient for MVP development (PostgreSQL migration comes later)
- Hot-reload and development tooling are essential for developer productivity
- Logging infrastructure is designed for local development (console/stdout/stderr) with easy migration path to external observability tools post-MVP

## Dependencies

- Docker Desktop (local development)
- GitHub Actions (CI/CD)
- Trunk CLI (code quality)
- Node.js and Python build tools (managed via Docker)

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-01-27

- Q: What is the deployment architecture for this project? → A: All infrastructure is local-only for MVP (Docker containers running on developer machines). Cloud hosting and production deployment is explicitly post-MVP.
- Q: Should we implement actual application features? → A: No, this is infrastructure setup only. All app features are out of scope. Only scaffolds, configuration, and development tooling are included.
- Q: What logging approach should be used? → A: Structured logging setup (logging levels, formatted output, standardized patterns) with easy-to-extend architecture for future observability needs.

## Out of Scope

This feature sets up project infrastructure and development tooling only. The following are explicitly **NOT** included:

- **Application Features**: No implementation of time logging, activity tracking, dashboards, or other application functionality
- **Cloud Hosting**: All deployment is local-only for MVP. Production cloud hosting is post-MVP
- **Authentication**: No authentication system or user management
- **Database Migration to PostgreSQL**: SQLite is used exclusively for MVP
- **Production Monitoring**: Logging infrastructure is setup-ready but no external observability tools (e.g., Sentry, Datadog) are integrated
- **Multi-user Support**: Single-user local-only architecture

## Open Questions & [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]

None. All requirements are clear based on industry standards and constitution guidance.
